# CodeProfiles

This repository wraps into a Maven project an original piece of code and artwork by  [W. Bradford Paley](http://wbpaley.com/brad/).

The original source code can be found [here](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/codedoc/Paley/code.html), hosted by the by the [Whitney Museum's portal to Internet art](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/Artport). It was written August 9-15 2002 for CODeDOC; commissioned by Christiane Paul, Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, NY USA 

More than 14 years after its creation, we were very much inspired by this very nice and cool art work. Putting it on github, we wanted to, hopefully, increase its visibility.
